# ChatGPT-Screenshot-Evaluation-Chrome-Extension
An extension that takes a screenshot of your current chrome tab and then returns a description of that tab using ChatGPT

This is my first chrome extension I've programmed. For full transparency, I did use ChatGPT to help understand some of the chrome documentation as well as help with troubleshooting. 

To install, you need to download the files and install as an unpacked extension using developer mode. Chrome blocks the crx files since its not from the webstore. There are ways to bypass the block but its easier to just install as an unpacked extension.

Before you use, make sure you go to the details page of the extension then the extension options. You will then be able to enter your OpenAi API key, which is necessary to use with the extension. 

After the set up, simply open the extension while on a webpage and your should get a description within a few seconds.
